# nmap-port-scanner
Created a simple script in python with the nmap tool.
This script performs port scanning on a target IP Address. This is super basic right now, but you can customize it further to
suit your needs or add more advanced features.

Please note, you need these before running the script.
You will have to install nmap to your computer if it's not installed already from:
https://nmap.org/

You will also have to install the nmap module: (if it's not already installed)
you can use this command: pip install python-nmap
